abstract: Extensive redundant links and dedicated network components are
  deployed in existing networks to avoid network congestion caused by peak
  traffic. These network components are underutilized, leading to an extreme
  waste of electrical energy and negative environmental consequences. Most
  energy efficiency schemes have little consideration of the subsequent traffic
  load as well as the impact of energy saving on network performance, which
  brings many challenges, such as frequent flow rerouting, continual device
  state transition, and network load imbalance. In this article, we propose an
  energy efficiency optimization framework based on traffic prediction in
  software-defined networking, aiming at reducing network energy consumption
  while ensuring communication quality. First, we design a real-time traffic
  prediction mechanism based on gated recurrent unit neural network of deep
  learning to capture the temporal characteristics of network traffic and
  provide data basis for the deployment of energy-saving strategies. Second, we
  propose a heuristic algorithm for energy efficiency optimization to balance
  flow demand and energy consumption and to achieve dynamic load balancing and
  energy saving. Finally, simulation is carried out through Ryu controller,
  Mininet, and TensorFlow. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves
  about 47.71% reduction in terms of the overall energy consumption with good
  network load balancing.
