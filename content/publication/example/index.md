abstract: "Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) sinks computation

  and storage capacities to network edge, where it is close to users

  to support delay-sensitive services. However, due to the dynamic

  and stochastic properties of MEC networks, the deployed services

  may be frequently migrated among edge servers to follow the

  mobility of users, which greatly increases the network operational

  cost. In this paper, considering the service migration cost brought

  by user mobility, we study the joint optimization problem of

  service deployment and request routing decisions to maximize the

  long-term network utility of MEC networks. Firstly, we propose a

  Lyapunov optimization-based online service migration algorithm

  to decompose the continuous optimization problem into a number

  of one-slot online optimization problems. Then, to address the

  NP-hard issue of one-slot optimization, we use a randomized

  rounding technique to implement service migration and request

  routing. Furthermore, through a closed-form theoretical analysis,

  we prove that the proposed algorithm not only greatly meets the

  local user requests and enables approximate performance guar\x02antees, but
  also adaptively balances the service migration cost

  and system performance online. Finally, extensive simulations are

  conducted, which demonstrate that our algorithm can efficiently

  utilize the storage and computation resources of edge servers,

  and maximize the long-term network utility while ensuring the

  stability of service migration cost."

  deployed services may be frequently migrated among edge servers to follow the
  mobility of users, which greatly increases the network operational cost.
